# CS50-Problem-Set-0
Problem set 0 program written in Scratch

You play as the snowman, who needs to avoid the sun to prevent being melted.  Use the sun to eliminate the ghosts while avoiding it.  Because everything starts randomly placed, you may start off in a losing position or you may not be able to win every time.

The game is written in Scratch, which is at https://scratch.mit.edu/
